	<p class="text-primary">
		Ecommerce is a method of buying and selling goods and services online.
		<b><u class="text-success">The definition of ecommerce
				business can also include tactics like affiliate marketing.</u></b> You can
		use ecommerce channels such as your own website, an established <b
			class="text-success">selling website</b> like Amazon, or social media
		to drive online sales.
	</p>
	<p class="text-primary">
		"Ecommerce" or "electronic commerce" is the trading of goods and
		services on the internet. It is your bustling city center or
		brick-and-mortar shop translated into zeroes and ones on the internet
		superhighway. An estimated <b class="text-success">2.14 billion</b>
		people worldwide buy goods and services online, and the number of
		Prime members shopping Amazon stores globally now tops <b
			class="text-success">200 million.</b> Ecommerce is one way people buy
		and sell things in retail. Some companies sell products online only,
		while other sellers use ecommerce as a part of a <b
			class="text-success">broader strategy </b>that includes physical
		stores and other distribution channels. Either way, ecommerce allows <b
			class="text-success">startups, small businesses, and large
			companies</b> to sell products at scale and reach customers across the
		world.

	<h2 class="text-danger">What is an ecommerce website?</h2>
	<p class="text-primary">An ecommerce website is your digital <b class="text-success">storefront</b>on the internet. It
	facilitates the transaction between a buyer and seller. It is the
	virtual space where you <b class="text-success">showcase products,</b> and online customers make
	selections. Your website acts as the product shelves, sales staff, and
	cash register of your<b class="text-success"> online business channel.</b> Businesses might create
	a <b class="text-success">branded store experience</b> on a store like Amazon, build their own
	commerce site on a dedicated domain, or do it all for a multi-channel
	approach.</p>
